# Effective-C
This repository will document my journey through Robert C. Seacord's book.

'Effective C' is an introduction into C programming, only with an high emphasis on safety. My interest in safety critical systems prompted me to buy a copy of this book and figure out for myself, how dangerous C can truly be.
